TODO:
figure out wait_block vs wait_pause, make these settings clear
change settings to "modified defaults", so a settings file needs less data if defaults are correct
refactor densities out of a list, and make each its own config file. Instead, make it easy to run multiple configs, or read in multiple configs at once (probably overkill)
